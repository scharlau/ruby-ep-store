This is a simple example of using the Product Advertising API so that you can
display items from Amazon on your web pages. We'll use it to download the

http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~csc228/teaching/CS5302/practicals/ruby/practical2.shtml
where you can find more details about installing and using this application.
